                                        JavaScript Operators
Arithmetic Operator 
Arithmetic Operators  perform mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
Example:-
const sum = 5 + 3; // Addition
const diff = 10 - 2; // Subtraction
const p = 4 * 2; // Multiplication
const q = 8 / 2; // Division
console.log(sum, diff, p, q);
2.  Assignment Operators
Assignment Operators  are used to assign values to variables. They can also perform operations like addition or multiplication before assigning the value.
Example:
let n = 10;
n += 5;
n *= 2;
console.log(n);
3.  Comparison Operators
   Comparison Operators are used compare two values and return a boolean (true or false). They are useful for making decisions in conditional statements.
Example:-
     console.log(10 > 5);    console.log(10 === "10");
4. Logical Operators
Logical Operators are mainly used to perform the logical operations that determine the equality or difference between the values.
Example:-
const a = true, b = false;
console.log(a && b); // Logical AND
console.log(a || b); // Logical OR
5.  Bitwise Operators
Bitwise Operators perform operations on binary representations of numbers.
Example:-
         const res = 5 & 1; // Bitwise AND
               console.log(res);
6.  Ternary Operator
Ternary Operatoris a shorthand for conditional statements. It takes three operands.
Example:-
const age = 18;
const status = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
console.log(status);








                                              JavaScript Loops
1. for Loop
The for loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times. It contains initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in one line.
Example:-
                     for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
                      console.log("Count:", i);
                      }
while loop
The while loop executes as long as the condition is true. It can be thought of as a repeating if statement.
Example:-
let i = 0;
while (i < 3) {
    console.log("Number:", i);
    i++;
}

3. do-while Loop
The do-while loop is similar to while loop except it executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.
Example:-
let i = 0;
do {
    console.log("Iteration:", i);
    i++;
} while (i < 3);

4. for-in Loop
The for in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object. It only iterate over keys of an object which have their enumerable property set to “true”.
Example:-
const obj = { name: "Ashish", age: 25 };
for (let key in obj) {
    console.log(key, ":", obj[key]);
}
